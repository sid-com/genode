The VFS named_pipe plugin enables data transfer via file handles from one
component to another. E.g. you can attach stdin of a libc component to a named
pipe and write data using standard fwrite() calls.

Here a sample scenario where stdin of a component is attached to a named pipe:

```
<start name="vfs">
	<provides> <service name="File_system"/> </provides>
	<resource name="RAM" quantum="4M"/>
	<config>
		<vfs>
			<dir name="upstream">
				<named_pipe/>
			</dir>
		</vfs>
		<default-policy root="/" writeable="yes"/>
	</config>
</start>

<start name="my-libc-app">
	<resource name="RAM" quantum="4M"/>
	<config>
		<vfs>
			<dir name="dev">
				<dir name="pipe"> <fs/> </dir>
				<log/>
			</dir>
		</vfs>
		<libc stdin="/dev/pipe/upstream/out" stdout="/dev/log" stderr="/dev/log"/>
	</config>
</start>
```

The directory named `upstream` represents a pipe and contains an `in` and `out`
file for writing and reading respectively to the pipe.

A remote component can now write to `/dev/pipe/upstream/in` so the data written
is then accessible on stdin within "my-libc-app". Once the remote component
closes the `/dev/pipe/upstream/in` file, an EOF is received on stdin of
"my-libc-app".

Reads and writes are non-blocking and will complete short operations without
error, with the exception of reads on an empty pipe, which return READ_QUEUED.
The read and write capacity of a pipe may be queried by stat'ing the size of
`out` and `in` files.
